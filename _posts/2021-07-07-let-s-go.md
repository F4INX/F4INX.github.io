I decided to start a blog where I could post some ideas I find interesting instead of letting them be forgotten.

Among topics I might discuss:

* Why ground plane inductance is not what you think.

* Why differential line are trendy nowaways. Hint 1: it's related to reference plane changes.

* Why you should not use an helix antenna outside of its passband.

* Why a power amplifier on large signal conditions has not only a different impedance than on small signal conditions, but in fact has TWO output impedances.

* Which formula should you use in your Excel spreadsheet to calculate microstrip line impedances.

* Why ring filters seem to not suffer from variations of the dielectric constant of PCB substrate. Hint: this is related to substrate anisotropy. More to come on this.
